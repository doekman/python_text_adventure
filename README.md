# python_text_adventure

The most minimal text adventure game I can make (part of a tutorial)

*Demonstrates:*

- using a *function* called `answerQuestion` to limit the accepted input.
- choosing a different next step depending on the answer to a question.
- repeating the question until they give a valid answer
- adding something to a *global variable* called the `inventory`
- checking if something is in the inventory (so it can't be added again)
- having options that are only possible, or have different outcomes, depending on what is in the `inventory`.
- different endings, and how to exit


# How to Play

- Open a console (also called a terminal)
- Go to the folder that has the file `game.py`
- type: `python .\game.py`
- when you are sick of playing press `[ctrl]+[c]`
