# python_text_adventure
The most minimal text adventure game I can make (part of a tutorial)

Demonstrates:

- using a function called `answerQuestion` to limit the accepted input.
- choosing a different next step depending on the answer to a question.
- adding something to the inventory
- checking if something is in the inventory (so it can't be added again)
- having options that are only possible or have different outcomes depending on what is in the inventory.
- different endings
